SRE-Lab â€” Hands-on Site Reliability Engineering & Observability Project

Welcome to SRE-Lab, a hands-on project designed to simulate real-world Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), observability, and automation practices.

This lab showcases:
	â€¢	Microservices Architecture â€” containerized services (Python, Node.js, Go) running with Docker/Kubernetes.
	â€¢	Observability & Monitoring â€” Prometheus + Grafana dashboards, alerts, and logs.
	â€¢	Automation & Infrastructure-as-Code â€” Terraform for cloud infrastructure, Ansible for configuration management, GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines.
	â€¢	Resilience Engineering â€” chaos experiments, self-healing scripts, fault tolerance strategies.
	â€¢	Security & Detection â€” Suricata IDS, Splunk log analysis, and vulnerability scanning.
	â€¢	Incident Management â€” RCA templates, postmortems, and operational runbooks.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project is both a learning lab and a portfolio showcase. It helps me sharpen practical SRE/DevOps/Cybersecurity skills while demonstrating end-to-end capabilities across:
	â€¢	Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)
	â€¢	DevOps/Automation (Terraform, Ansible, CI/CD)
	â€¢	Observability (Grafana, Prometheus, Datadog, Splunk, Nagios)
	â€¢	Resilience & Security (Chaos testing, IDS, incident response)

0ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sre-lab-wilnick.git
cd sre-lab-wilnick

un the base services (to be added in upcoming commits):

docker compose up --build

Health check endpoints:
	â€¢	http://localhost:8000/users/health
	â€¢	http://localhost:8001/orders/health
	â€¢	http://localhost:8002/inventory/health


ðŸ“– Project Roadmap

This project evolves week by week:
	1.	Microservices & CI setup
	2.	Observability (Prometheus/Grafana)
	3.	Automation (Terraform/Ansible/CI-CD)
	4.	Resilience & Chaos Engineering
	5.	Security (Suricata, Splunk)
	6.	Incident Mgmt & Documentation

Each stage will be documented in docs/ with screenshots, configs, and learnings.
